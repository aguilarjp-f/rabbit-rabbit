/*
First Condition (IF statement):

MIN([~ dateDiff (Month)]) = 0 AND AVG([~ daysPassed (Complete)]) < 7:
MIN([~ dateDiff (Month)]) = 0 checks if the current data is from the current month (0 means the current month).
AVG([~ daysPassed (Complete)]) < 7 checks if the average number of days passed is less than 7.
If true, it projects the spend for the current month using:
SUM([# spendMTD (Excl. LXD)]) (total spend so far, excluding LXD).
It adds the projected spend for the remaining days of the month ([ # spendAvgDaily ] * [~ daysLeft (MTD)]).
Second Condition (ELSEIF statement):

MIN([~ Datediff (Week)]) = 0:
This checks if the data is from the current week (0 means the current week).
If true, it projects the spend by:
SUM([# spendMTD (Excl. LXD)]) (total spend so far).
Adding the average daily spend from the last 7 days (SUM([# Spend (L7D)]) / 7), multiplied by the remaining days in the month (AVG([~ daysLeft (MTD)])).
Default Condition (ELSE statement):

If neither condition is true, it simply returns the total spend (SUM([Spend])).
